A project to demonstrate use of C# to create a reasonably simple Windows forms application

* A top down survival shooter controlled by mouse and keyboard
* Enemies are procedurally genereated by random and exhibit different behaviours, attacking each other and the player and either running away from or toward others
* The camera is fixed to the player, other objects are discarded when they move too far off screen
* The background and all objects are drawn using GDI+
* Background seamlessly tiles as the screen moves
* Dark mode partially obscures screen with the exception of a torch outline that follows the cursor
